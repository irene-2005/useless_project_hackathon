### Project Description
🐍 Dhashamoolam — The Savage Reply Bot

"Because the world needed one more useless project… now with Malayalam attitude."

Built for the Useless Projects Hackathon, Dhashamoolam is our proud contribution to the global pile of things nobody asked for. It’s a chatbot that doesn’t just roast you in text — it shouts Malayalam movie-style dialogues at you as audio.

Instead of helping humanity, we built something that will ruin your day in two languages and two formats — text and voice.

Key Features:

🔥 Full-Time Savage — No greetings, no manners, just verbal destruction.

🎯 Contextual Roasts — Burns tailored to your exact message.

🎤 Malayalam Movie Dialogue Mode — Hear the savagery with cinematic flair.

⚡ Instant Comebacks — Faster than your “enna?” reaction time.

🎛 Adjustable Burn Levels — From “chettan-level teasing” to “full villain monologue.”

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are just not getting roasted enough in their daily lives.
Conversations are too polite, too kind, and tragically lacking in savage Malayalam movie comebacks. This alarming lack of verbal chaos is a threat to boredom levels everywhere.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Dhashamoolam — a chatbot that delivers brutal text roasts and blasts you with legendary Malayalam dialogues as audio.
It’s the perfect cure for peace and quiet. Just type something, and the bot will return both a sarcastic reply and a cinematic verbal smackdown.
If you ask us whether it is useful...well Nah Just another way to procastinate..
